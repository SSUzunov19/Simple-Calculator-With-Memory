# Simple Calculator With Memory
This is a basic calculator developed in Python and tkinter, designed for users who prefer to perform arithmetic operations in Bulgarian. The calculator supports the four basic arithmetic operations, as well as other features such as percentage, square root, factorial, memory storage, and retrieval.

# How to use
To use the calculator, simply run the Python script and a window will appear with the calculator interface. The keypad includes buttons for the different operations and inputs, while the display window shows the current expression. To perform a calculation, click the relevant buttons on the keypad to enter the numbers and operators needed, and the result will be displayed in the expression window. The memory buttons can be used to store and retrieve values, and the AC button clears the calculator.

# Memory usage
The calculator provides four memory buttons (M+, M-, MR, MC) for storing and retrieving values in memory. Here's how to use them:

Example:<br>
    Suppose you want to add two numbers, 5 and 7, and store the result in memory. Here's how you would do it:<br>

Enter "5" on the calculator keypad and click the "+" button.<br>
Enter "7" on the keypad and click the "=" button to get the result, "12".<br>
Click the "M+" button to store the result, "12", in memory.<br>
To retrieve the value from memory later, simply click the "MR" button. The value "12" will be displayed on the calculator's screen.<br>
To clear the value in memory, click the "MC" button. The stored value will be removed and the memory will be empty.<br>

# How to run
To run the calculator, follow these steps:

First, make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Download or clone the repository to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the repository is located.

Start the calculator by running the following command:

<pre>python calculator.py</pre>

# Features
The calculator interface is designed to be easy to use, with buttons labeled in Bulgarian.

The calculator code is written in a way that is easy to understand and modify, allowing users to customize it to their needs.

The calculator can be used as a starting point for building more advanced calculator applications with additional features and functionality.
